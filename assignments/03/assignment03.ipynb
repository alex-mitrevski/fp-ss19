Since we are interested in a maximal chain, $\\bot$ is always included in $S$, such that we will denote $d_1 = \\bot$. The highest element in a chain does not have $\\bot$ for any $D_i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and is also always included in $S$; we will let $d_k$ represent this element of the chain. For any other element $d_i$ in $S$, $\\bot$ can be included up to $n - 1$ times, such that, due to the fact that the chain is totally ordered, permutations of the elements of $d_i$ are not allowed in $S$. But since we are looking for a maximal chain, $d_i \\neq d_1 \\neq d_k$ represent all possible combinations of ordered pairs in which $\\bot$ appears at least once and at most $n - 1$ times. There are $n - 1$ such combinations; together with $d_1$ and $d_k$, there are a total of $n + 1$ elements in $S$, which is the maximum cardinality $S$ can have. $\\square$."
