# Functional Programming, RWTH Aachen, SS19

This repository contains:
* My solutions to the course assignments (nine in total) (the assignments were submitted in groups of four, so these are *my own* solutions). All assignment solutions are in separate Jupyter notebooks.
* A handwritten (written using [Notability](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notability/id360593530)) summary/translation of the definitions, theorems, and lemmas in the course notes, which can be found in their original German version [here](https://verify.rwth-aachen.de/fp19/FP19.pdf)
